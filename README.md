The snake-like robot incorporates advanced engineering principles, such as modular design for adaptability to various terrains, and utilizes sophisticated sensors and control systems to ensure precise navigation and task execution

2017, during a family trip to Qinghai and Gansu, I witnessed the harsh conditions of the desert and Gobi, as well as the arduous efforts of desert management. Inspired by this experience, in 2019, I constructed a LEGO EV3-based robot capable of planting trees and conducting inspections in desert and Gobi environments. This robot demonstrated basic mobility functions, though in retrospect, it resembled more of a toy. Nonetheless, it marked the beginning of my application of engineering technology to environmental governance.
This year, I have designed and manufactured a snake-like robot that is adept at navigating desert environments and rugged terrains, including narrow caves and other harsh conditions. The design of this snake-like robot allows for future development into a multi-modal, freely switchable robot, gradually expanding its applications to include inspection tasks in terrains such as cable trenches.
The snake-like robot incorporates advanced engineering principles, such as modular design for adaptability to various terrains, and utilizes sophisticated sensors and control systems to ensure precise navigation and task execution. Its articulated joints enable it to maneuver through complex and confined spaces, making it an ideal solution for challenging inspection and maintenance scenarios.
Furthermore, the robot's modularity allows for easy customization and upgradeability, enabling it to adapt to evolving technological advancements and diverse operational requirements. This design philosophy not only enhances the robot's functionality but also ensures its relevance and effectiveness in a wide array of environmental and industrial applications.

The multi-sphere design leverages advanced engineering principles, including modular architecture for adaptability, and employs sophisticated sensors and control systems to ensure precise navigation and task execution. The articulated joints provide the robot with the capability to maneuver through intricate and confined spaces, making it an ideal solution for challenging inspection and maintenance scenarios.

Furthermore, the robot's modularity facilitates easy customization and upgradeability, allowing it to keep pace with technological advancements and diverse operational requirements. This design approach not only enhances the robot's functionality but also ensures its longevity and effectiveness across a wide range of environmental and industrial applications.
